Welcome to the steganograph-app-y! This is a Python application where you can try out exisiting steganographic algorithms as well as a new algorithm proposed and implemented by me on an easy-to-use GUI.

# Getting Started

To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/FaiZaman/Steganograph-app-y.git
cd Steganograph-app-y
```

# Running

To run the application, navigate to the root directory and run the following command:

```
python Main.py
```

Note that your system must be running Python 3.7 or a later version for the application to function properly.
